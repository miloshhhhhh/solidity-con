// Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications 
// — all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.

// An empty contract named HelloWorld would look like this:

contract HelloWorld {

}


// Version Pragma 
// All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" — a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

}

// 
// Variables

// State variables are permanently stored in contract storage.
// This means they're written to the Ethereum blockchain. Think of them like writing to a DB.
